# Popup Search

A browser extension, made with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in Cursor, that enables quick popup
searching using keyboard shortcuts and configurable search engines. 

## Usage

### Demo
Below you can see me using the main access keys (1,2,3) to bring up popup searches on various highlighted pieces of text from an article.
I then use the selector to bring up even more options like HN Algolia and Youtube.

Among the configuration options, you can set a maximum number of windows constraint. Here you can see me setting it to 2, and then showing
how it automatically closes older windows you may have left open in order to prevent clutter.
