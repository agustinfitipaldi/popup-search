# Popup Search

A browser extension, made with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in Cursor, that enables quick popup
searching using keyboard shortcuts and configurable search engines. 

## Usage

### Demo
Below you can see me using the main access keys (1,2,3) to bring up popup searches on various highlighted pieces of text from an article.
I then use the selector to bring up even more options like HN Algolia and Youtube.

Among the configuration options, you can set a maximum number of windows constraint. Here you can see me setting it to 2, and then showing
how it automatically closes older windows you may have left open in order to prevent clutter.

Also in configuration options is the ability to add more search engines. For example, I found myself wanting a "phrase explainer", something 
I could use while reading an article where the author takes a few too many literary excursions. A simple modification of the base Kagi query,
with some "pre-prompt" and a question mark suffix (to trigger Kagi's AI summarizer) did the trick wonderfully.

`https://kagi.com/search?q=Explain this phrase, "{query}"?`

Leads to your highlighted text getting spliced inbetween those quotation marks. Furthermore, I think but do not know, that since you are using
quotations, Kagi does a literal search and so the AI gets a very short list of search results, likely just the article you were reading, giving
it extra focus on the surrounding context of the article.

This example shows how this could be used for rather flexible objectives. Essentially anything you can get to by splicing in a query, or pre-set
by modifying the url is fair game!

### Basic Steps

1. Select any text on a webpage
2. You can either press one of the `Alt + 1/2/3` for your "speed-dials" or `Alt + S` to bring up the selector
3. (if in the selector) Press the corresponding assigned shortcut to bring up the search popup
4. You can also right-click and select the search option from the Popup Search context menu

## Features
